# Generation NYC Patterns

The patterns library of Generation NYC is a work-in-progress, featuring the redesign efforts to create a meaningful resource for NYC teens and young adults.

## Getting Started
The patterns library is still in development and is therefore not yet published to npm. To install the current development patterns library in your application:

```
npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/NYCOpportunity/generationnyc-patterns.git#dev
```
